    "### Allen function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments\n",
    "##### The allen function allows for the selection of tracer experiments based upon primary injections sites and retrograde tracer activity. The functions accepts a number of arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROI_anterograde: ROI_anterograde has to be a ROI derived from 'http://api.brain-map.org/api/v2/structure_graph_download/1.json'. All experiments with primary injection  sites in that ROI will be exported as nifti file                             \n",
    "- ROI_retrograde: ROI_anterograde has to be a ROI derived from 'http://api.brain-map.org/api/v2/structure_graph_download/1.json'. All experiments in which the tracer activity surpassed a treshold in that ROI will be exported as a nifti file     \n",
    "                             \n",
    "- data: The wild-tracer which should be downloaded via the 'allen_download' function. The data should be imported in python as numpy array\n",
    "- activity_treshold: The activity_treshold specifies the amount of tracer-activity single voxels have to have in order to count towards the area treshold. The activity_treshold can be any value between 0 and 1 (default = 0.2)\n",
    "- area_treshold: The area_treshold specifies the fraction of voxels of ROI that have to match the activity treshold in order for ROI to be considered to have significant tracer activity (and hence be included into the ROI_retrograde tracer nifti file). When using larger ROI's (for example the isocortex), you definitely want to lower the area_treshold. The area_treshold can be any value between 0 and 1 (default = 0.05)\n",
    "- mask: Specifies whether a binary mask should be created for the ROI's (default=False)\n",
    "- is_injection: Determines whether selected experiments for the retrograde tracer should include experiments in which the primary injection site is located in ROI itself (default=False)\n",
    "- directory: The directory in which the output will be exported (default=current directory)\n",
    "- resolution The resolution of the tracer-data. This should match the resolution of the downloaded tracer data. I strongly recommend to keep it at 100 muM, since the function will require much more memory and time to run if the resolution is increased\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- the data can be loaded into python with the following code\n",
    "- import numpy as np\n",
    "- import nibabel as nib\n",
    "- import pandas as pd\n",
    "- import os\n",
    "- data= nib.load('tracer_data_masked.nii.gz')\n",
    "- data = np.array(data.dataobj)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "#####\n",
    "- allen(): displays a help message\n",
    "- allen('Infralimbic area', None, data): creates a nifti file for all the experiments with a primary injection site in the infralimbic area\n",
    "- allen(None, 'Prelimbic area', data, mask=True): creates a nifti file for all the experiments with tresholded tracer activity in the  prelimbic area (not including experiments in which there was a primary injection site in the prelimbic area) and also creates a mask\n",
    "- allen (None, 'Prelimbic area', data, mask=True, is_injection=True): the same as before, but now also includes experiments in which there was a primary injection site in the region\n",
    "- allen (None, 'Secondary motor area', data, activity_treshold=0.3): creates a nifti file for all the experiments with tresholded tracer activity in the secondary motor area at an activity_treshold of 0.3\n",
    "- allen (None, 'Secondary motor area',data, area_treshold=0.1): creates a nifti file for all the experiments with tresholded tracer activity in the secondary motor area at an area treshold of 0.1\n",
    "- allen ('Anterior cingulate area', 'Anterior cingulate area', data, directory= 'home/example'): creates two nifti files, one with all the tracer data with a primary injection site in the anterior cingulate area, and one with all experiments with tresholded tracer activity in the anterior cingulate area (not including experiments in which there was a primary injection site in the anterior cingulate area). And exports the nifti files to a custom directory\n"
